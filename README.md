# WrestlingTask

In this task we created a battle simulator game using JAVA. The parent class within this project was named "Wrestler". 
There were two subclasses, the first being "Lightweight", and second one being "Heavyweight". These two subclasses inherit attributes from the Wrestler class.
The main aim of this game was to make the two subclasses fight with one another, and to have a winner at the end.
